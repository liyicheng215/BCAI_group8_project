## fMRI MVPA Feature Selection and Classification

This repository contains code for voxel-level fMRI decoding of emotional arousal and memory recall using Multi-Voxel Pattern Analysis (MVPA). The project compares several feature selection strategies (random, top-k correlation, variance, Neurosynth, PCA, ICA) and classification models (SVM with multiple kernels, logistic regression) to evaluate their predictive performance on picture-level fMRI data.

The included Jupyter notebook demonstrates data preprocessing, feature construction, model training, cross-validation, and visualization of results. It provides a reproducible pipeline for analyzing fMRI datasets and investigating the impact of voxel selection and model choice on decoding performance.
